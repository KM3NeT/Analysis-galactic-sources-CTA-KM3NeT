# Analysis data

This folder holds the data created or used during the analysis, including plots, which can be generated using the notebooks in the `/Analysis` folder. In order to read the files correctly, the file path can be set manually in the `/Analysis/analysis_config.yml` file. It is by default set to the relative path of this folder.

Also following the main steps of the analysis, the following folders can be found here:

* **models** contains source model files for the selected sources and data sets generated by the _Fit_models_ notebook
* **cta** and **km3net** contain the IRFs from the detectors, generated pseudodata sets and plots from the IRFs for the field of view of the sources. They are used by the _Create__X__dataets_, which generates the pseudodata sets, and _Plot__X__dataesets_ notebooks.
* **linelihood_analysis** contains the scan results for the analysis performed on the pseudodata sets.

A further description of the data can be found in the respective folders.

If not designated differently, all data sets carry a CC-By license by the KM3NeT collaboration.
